#### Guide: Obtain YouTube API Authorization Token Without Custom Credentials

This guide will help you get a YouTube API authorization token for testing purposes using Googleâ€™s OAuth 2.0 Playground without requiring a Client ID and Client Secret.

##### **Step 1: Access OAuth 2.0 Playground**

- Go to the [OAuth 2.0 Playground](https://developers.google.com/oauthplayground/).
- This tool allows you to interact with Google APIs and generate authorization tokens.

##### **Step 2: Select YouTube API Scopes**

- Look for the **YouTube Data API scopes** in Step 1 of the Playground.
- Choose the appropriate scopes depending on the API actions you want to test:
  - **`https://www.googleapis.com/auth/youtube`**: Full access to manage YouTube account.
  - **`https://www.googleapis.com/auth/youtube.readonly`**: Read-only access to YouTube account.
  - **`https://www.googleapis.com/auth/youtube.force-ssl`**: Allows uploading, managing, and retrieving video content securely, including captions.

##### **Step 3: Authorize the APIs**

- Click the **"Authorize APIs"** button.
- A Google sign-in page will appear:
  - Sign in with your Google account.
  - Grant the requested permissions.

##### **Step 4: Exchange Authorization Code for Tokens**

- After successful authorization, go to Step 2 of the Playground.
- Click the **"Exchange authorization code for tokens"** button.
- The Playground will generate:
  - **Access Token:** Use this token to make API requests.
  - (Optional) **Refresh Token:** If available, use this to get a new access token when the current one expires.

##### **Step 5: Test API Requests**

- Use Step 3 of the Playground to test API requests directly:
  1. Enter the YouTube API endpoint (e.g., `https://www.googleapis.com/youtube/v3/videos`).
  2. Add required parameters and headers.
  3. Use the generated access token for authentication.

##### **Limitations**

- **Short-lived Access Token:** The token typically expires in 1 hour.
- **Default Credentials Restrictions:** Some advanced API features may not be accessible.
- **No Persistent Refresh Token:** A new authorization process might be needed for extended testing.

##### **Recommendation for Advanced Testing**

For more comprehensive testing, create your own project in the [Google Cloud Console](https://console.cloud.google.com/) and obtain a **Client ID** and **Client Secret** to fully unlock the YouTube API features.

#### Getting YouTube API Access Token

To use the YouTube Captions Scraper tool, you need to obtain a YouTube API access token. Follow these steps:

- Go to the Google Cloud Console.
- Create a new project or select an existing project.
- Enable the YouTube Data API v3 for your project.
- Go to the "Credentials" section and create an OAuth 2.0 Client ID.
- Download the OAuth 2.0 Client ID JSON file.
- Use the OAuth 2.0 Client ID to obtain an access token. You can use the OAuth 2.0 Playground to generate the token.
- Copy the access token and add it to your .env file as VITE_YOUTUBE_LONG_LIVE_TOKEN.
